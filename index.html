<p><strong>Air Freight</strong></p>
<p>Air freight is the quickest way to move goods around the world. Planes can get goods from one side of the planet to another within a matter of days.&nbsp; When you add door service and customs clearance on each end, total transit time door to door can range from 2 to 5 days depending on the countries.</p>
<p>Air freight is generally several times more expensive than ocean freight.&nbsp; It should be used only for urgent shipments. However, air freight can be very competitive or even cheaper for many smaller shipments (generally under 500 kg).&nbsp;When packaging product, it is important to keep in mind the size restrictions on many aircraft. The most common is the height restriction of 63&rdquo; (160 cm) on wide body passenger planes.</p>
<p>Volume&nbsp; weight on air freight is calculated from the dimensions of the cargo, using a formula where 1 cubic meter equals 167 volume kg.&nbsp; Freight is charged on the higher of actual and volume weight.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Highland</strong>&nbsp;to custom design the best air freight solution for your next air import or export. Our experienced specialists will guide you through the process and suggest various alternatives to meet your deadlines and budget.</p>
<p><strong>Ocean Freight</strong></p>
<p>Ocean freight is the most economical way to move goods around the world. &nbsp;With the advent of containers 50 years ago, shipping costs have been slashed by a factor of 100.</p>
<p>Containers come in two basic sizes: 20 foot and 40 foot. However there are many variations on these such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard containers (closed top, 8 foot high)</li>
<li>High cube containers (available only for 40 foot and 45 foot length)</li>
<li>Open top containers (20 foot, 40 foot)</li>
<li>Flat racks (20 foot, 40 foot) &ndash; in several configurations</li>
</ul>
<p>For smaller shipments (such as a few pallets), the solution is LCL (less than container load). Many consolidators specialize in combining smaller shipments into containers and each party pays only a prorated cost of the container space. The secret of LCL is that it almost always travels on the fastest available transit between the two points.</p>
<p>For larger or heavier cargo that does not fit into containers, the solution is either flat racks or <strong>breakbulk shipping</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Highland</strong>&nbsp;to custom design the best ocean freight solution for your next ocean import or export. Our experienced specialists will guide you through the process and suggest various alternatives to meet your deadlines and budget.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trucking</strong></p>
<p>Highland arranges trucking around the world in conjunction with&nbsp;international moves by air and ocean. Trucks are where almost every journey starts and ends. Our contracts with thousands of carriers worldwide assure competitive prices and wide selection.</p>
<p>We only work with carriers adhering to strict safety standards and who have proven reliability record.</p>
<h2><strong>Trucking can take various forms:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>LTL (less than truckload) &ndash; for smaller shipments</li>
<li>Full closed truck &ndash; generally 48 foot or 53 foot trucks in USA/Canada</li>
<li>Flat bed trucks &ndash; 48 foot or 53 foot&nbsp; (can be tarped on request)</li>
<li>Air ride is an option for all truck types. Many carriers offer&nbsp;air ride.</li>
<li>Specialized truck &ndash;&nbsp;stepdecks and double drops for oversize moves</li>
<li>Triaxle chassis &ndash; available for heavy containers</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>In other countries, various additional truck types can be used:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Sideloader &ndash; a truck with a crane that can offload a container to the ground. This is very common in Europe where many companies do not have loading docks and prefer to unload from the ground.</li>
<li>Curtainside trailer &ndash; a regular truck with soft canvas sides that allows loading from the side.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contact Highland</strong>&nbsp;to custom design the best freight solution for your next ocean import or export choosing the best truck type as part of the international voyage.&nbsp; Our experienced specialists will guide you through the process and suggest various alternatives to meet your deadlines and budget.</p>
<p><strong>Barge</strong></p>
<p>River and coastal barges are an effective way of transport in many countries.</p>
<p>Barges can transport containers, Break bulk shipments, Bulk cements, chemicals, out gauge cargoes, Steel Products, Project Cargoes. &nbsp;Currently the Barges are very effecting to move the shipments within Upper Gulf and nearest countries</p>
<p>&gt;<strong>Contact Highland</strong>&nbsp;to see if using a barge as part of your international move could save you money and make a project that was not possible otherwise become a reality.&nbsp;Our experienced specialists will guide you through the process and suggest various alternatives to meet your deadlines and budget.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Charter</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to very large and/or very urgent shipments, sometimes a charter is the only viable solution. A charter can take the form of either air or surface transport.&nbsp;Most common air charters are super size planes such as the Antonov 124 that allow for shipments of abnormally large machines or vehicles by air which could not otherwise fit on any other freighter aircraft. (Typically cargo over 110&rdquo;=280 cm tall).</p>
<p>Charters in ocean transport are arranged for very large volumes of cargo (usually 5000 cubic meters or more) shipped at one time from the same place to the same destination. The advantage of charter (or part-charter) is that it allows for cost savings and commits a dedicated vessel between 2 ports that might not have been otherwise served on regular schedules.</p>
<p>Highland recently arranged a part charter vessel from Long Beach to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam in order to achieve a 26 day port/port transit time that was not otherwise available. The total volume of the breakbulk cargo was only around 400 cubic meters, but it had a very tight deadline. By suggesting this charter solution, Highland saved the client 50% of the freight cost compared to airfreight.</p>
<p>A charter can also refer to chartering a river or lake barge.</p>
<p><strong>Break Bulk</strong></p>
<p>Breakbulk cargo is referred to usually with oversize goods that are too large to fit in a container. Such cargo can then be shipped in several different ways:</p>
<h3>Options for static cargo (not on wheels or tracks, not drivable)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Loaded on flat racks, properly braced, blocked and secured</li>
<li>Loaded on mafis (flat rack like metal platforms on small wheels that are towed into the vessel.) The mafis travel on the ship but never leave the ports.</li>
<li>Loaded by crane into the cargo holds of the vessel where cargo is then secure</li>
<li>For very large or heavy cargo that cannot ship on a flat rack, we can still arrange &ldquo;breakbulk on container vessel&rdquo; option. This is used when fast transit is required, cargo is loaded onto container ship where multiple empty flat racks are waiting. The goods are loaded across all of these flat racks to spread the weight and size and secured on the ship. This option is typically very expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Options for ro/ro (roll on/roll-off) cargo (cars, trucks, tractors, etc)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Loaded on flat racks, properly braced, blocked and secured</li>
<li>The wheeled units are driven or towed directly into the vessel. This option is the least expensive way to ship since there is reduced handling.</li>
<li>Loaded by crane into the cargo holds of the vessel where cargo is then secured</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, proper bracing and securing of cargo is key to a successful voyage.&nbsp;Flat racks have the advantage of regular container ship schedules but generally have higher cost.</p>
<p>Not all options may be available to all destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Highland</strong>&nbsp;to find the best breakbulk solution for your next order</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project</strong></p>
<p>Highland excels at handling large scale projects. This typically means shipping cargo from multiple countries around the world (often 30+) to a single destination for a construction or expansion of a plant. This can be in many different industries such as cement, energy, mining, oil &amp; gas, solar, steel, wind, and others.</p>
<p>Each project can consist of hundreds or&nbsp;thousands of separate shipments, mostly sent by ocean. Tracking of each item is key and is provided in a format customized to each client and his needs.</p>
<p>In each project there are numerous opportunities to find cost savings for the client and Highland takes pride in working on behalf of the customer to maximize their potential savings. This can be done in many different ways, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combining various smaller orders at origin or in transit and sending larger shipments each time. Also see <strong>Charter</strong>and <strong>Merge in Transit</strong>.</li>
<li>Shipping orders that are not urgently needed the most economical way</li>
<li>Finding intermediate storage facilities during transit to assemble goods and then dispatch further as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the orders are called triangle shipments (see <strong>Triangle Shipments</strong>). This refers to shipments from country A to country B when the client is located in country C (such as shipping from Australia to Kazakhstan for a USA based client setting up a new gas refinery in Kazakhstan).</p>
<p>Please <strong>contact Highland</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>to see why so many large firms have come to trust and rely on Highland to manage the logistics&nbsp;for these immense industrial projects.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Customs Clearance</strong></p>
<p>Highland can coordinate customs clearance with brokers in USA. We also arrange customs clearance in all other countries through our partners worldwide.</p>
<p>We are familiar with&nbsp;and follow all customs rules and regulations. We&nbsp;guide each client through the process.&nbsp;With many DAP and DDP export shipments we will arrange clearance in most countries of the world, provide detailed advance quotes, duty rates and advise of possible additional documents required.</p>
<p>While many countries have a simple customs process with electronic releases, there are still many regions that are very paper intensive and the cost of the clearance process is then correspondingly high. In these markets, the clearance can take several days or more and often this means additional storage at the port and airport. This must be taken into consideration for any DAP or DDP shipment.</p>
<p>Even when exporting on DAP terms, make sure you clarify with your buyer(consignee) who will&nbsp;be responsible for storage in his country caused by slow clearance. Without defining this in advance, those costs will fall back to the exporter (shipper) even though they may have been caused by the consignee.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Packaging / Crating</strong></p>
<p>Every shipment must be properly packaged for transit. For some goods, a cardboard box is OK if shipping by air. Large ocean shipments may require heavy duty wooden crates that can cost thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>We arrange various types of packaging for clients around the world and it is important to consider the following in choosing the type of packaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air vs. Ocean</li>
<li>If ocean, is it <strong>LCL or FCL&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>Length of transit</li>
<li>How many transit points and reloading times</li>
<li>Weight and size of cargo</li>
<li>Type of the goods</li>
<li>Protection from&nbsp;moisture needed?</li>
</ul>
<p>We can arrange full or partial wooden boxing, vapor wrap, shock sensors, markings etc.</p>
<p>Finally, check the contract with your buyer. If you agreed on full wooden crates, you must supply those even if you might otherwise think a cardboard box is OK.</p>
<p><strong>Often overlooked items:</strong></p>
<p>One area that is sometimes overlooked is protection of cargo on the way from factory to the packer.&nbsp; Damage can occur before the goods can be protected well.</p>
<p>While the goods are at packer waiting for packing, are they in inside or outside storage?</p>
<p>If goods need air ride trucks or are sensitive to shocks, did you prohibit rail transport?</p>
<p>If you arranged crating for heavy breakbulk items, did you leave access panels so that a port crane can hook up their chains?</p>
<p>If your final crate width is&nbsp;92 inches wide, it will no longer fit through container doors. This could double or triple your shipping costs. Discuss final finished dimensions with your packer in advance</p>
<p>Packing is best handled by professional packers. Let us help you design the best solution so&nbsp;your goods are well protected for their overseas voyage.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carnets</strong></p>
<p>Carnet is a special document allowing for duty free transport of goods among many countries. It is issued and authorized by an insurance company and a Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the rules agreed upon by various participating countries. Not all countries recognize carnets, but most of the developed ones do.</p>
<p>The Carnet must list all the items in detail and show all intended destination countries.</p>
<p>Typically it is valid for 1 year.</p>
<h3>The most common uses are for example:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A music band will list all their music equipment on a world tour</li>
<li>An exhibitor at a trade show will list their booth and product being shown</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that none of the products listed on the Carnet can be sold. If there is any chance that a customer will&nbsp;buy the product, or if you are sending free samples to give away a carnet should not be used.</p>
<p>Highland frequently arranges Carnets for our customers. The best news is that a Carnet can be arranged in as few as 1-2 days. Please let us know how we can help and use a Carnet next time for a temporary import in other countries.</p>
